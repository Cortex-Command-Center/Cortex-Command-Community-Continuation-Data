# Cortex Command Community Continuation
This is where you can find the community's plans for Cortex Command's future. There'll be rebalancing, new weapons and units, and much more.

We are currently a little bit de-platformed. We're working on changing that.

# How to Play the Game
If you just want to play the latest version of the game you can get it from our releases page [website](https://github.com/Cortex-Command-Center/Cortex-Command-Community-Continuation-Engine/releases), and you can get mods from the [mod portal](https://www.moddb.com/games/cortex-command-community-continuation/mods). Alternatively, CCCP mods from their [mod.io](https://cccp.mod.io) will also mostly function, or be very trivial to convert.

# How To Make Your Voice Heard #

Due to our current deplatforming, it might be difficult to find a place dedicated to talking about this project. Until we fix that, your best bet is the temporary discord shown above, or github issues.

***

# How To Make Issues #

If you're familiar with github you should be familiar with making issues. It's as simple as going to the issues tab and clicking a button. Once you do that, you'll see an easy to follow template to fill in. After you've done that, try to put in the appropriate category for the issue and it'll be handled from there.

# How to Contribute #

If you've got experience with the game's ini data through modding it, are good at spriting or know Lua, maybe you can contribute some of your time directly to the project. We'll look at any pull requests that come in and are always happy to have more hands on deck.
If you're an experienced programmer (particularly with C++), there's also tons of work to be done in our [source](https://github.com/Cortex-Command-Center/Cortex-Command-Community-Continuation-Engine) repository.
